## First Time Login

Before using the GetIN App, Login is required to ensure that the integrity of the data on the phone is kept. Only Health Workers who have been registered through the [GetIN Dashboard](htps://getinmobile.org) by the District Health officer.

**Credentials**

  For best User Experience, we recommend using a simple username for the Health worker and an easy to remember password like a specific Phone Number. This helps the Healthworker to quickly remember their password and also enables the System support team to easily remind these workers incase they forget their passwords.

   **Password Cards**

  We recommend providing Hard Paper Cards to Community Health Workers to store their credentials.Most of them are first time users of Smartphones and have not used passwords. A Password card provides a reference everytime a Healthworker forgets a password or username.

   **Internet Connection**

   First Time Login requires strong internet connection as the mobile client makes authentication calls to the GetIN server. A spot with H+, 3G or higher connection is recommended.
   The subsequent Login times require little or no strong connection since the credentials are stored locally on the mobile phone.

## Using GetIN the field

    
   **Mapping**
    Mapping of new girls in the GetIN App requires no active network or internet connection.
    Clicking the Upload to server button saves the record locally on phone and sends a copy to server if there is a strong network connection.
    Health workers are advised to locate Internet Hotspots where they turn on cellular data so that auto snycronisation with the serve can occur.

**Checking Missed/ Attended ANC**
    This feature requires internet connection so as to enable sync with the Midwife records and view which girls have attended or missed Antenatal Care.
    This is found in the Upcoming Appointments Feature of the App.

## Extending Battery LIfe
     

GetIN operates in rural areas and some of these have poor or no electricity coverage.This makes charging difficult and can have impact on the project implementation.

**Type of Phone for the Project**
    It is important to check the specifications of the Phone to use in the project before it is purchased. We recommend phones with longer  battery life.

**Battery saver mode**
    When not in use and field mapping, it is good to put the phone in  battery saver mode because closes background tasks and reduces the light thus prolonging battery life.

**Close Unwanted Appliations**
    Running too many APPs can quickly drain battery. Close unused applications and widgets like Cellular Data, Wifi, Bluetooth etc.

## Protecting Smart Phones
  

We recommend purchasing screen protectors and phone covers given the nature of the implemention areas and environment. These ensure that the phone has a longer lifespan even when it falls down.
